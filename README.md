Java Mini Project

Our problem statement is to connect users in a GUI window so that they
can share their thoughts using chats. This window for this purpose which cannot
be hosted in a real server should be hosted in a development environment at the
same time. So we are multithreading it to make the work of the developer easier.
The GUI is a simple chat window for client and server. It must add new
messages as it receives and have a textfield to send new messages to the other
side.

Our objective is to achieve a chat application with multithreading features
and have a simple GUI to interact with it.

Concepts Used:
 
1. Java Multithreading
2. Java Sockets
3. Java AWT
